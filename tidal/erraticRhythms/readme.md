## Erratic Rhythms
Live coding with Tidal Cycles and the Didactic Pattern Visualizer

*Erratic Rhythms* is composed live coding that demonstrates rhythmic patterns arranged with visualization. There are 4 separate parts, each with its own distinct rhythmic character. The patterns were created so that each part stands out without "lining up" on the beats. The piece evolves so that the parts are played in different groups of 2 and 3 parts sounding together. Each part has a different timbre, using synthesizers available in SuperDirt (superhex, psin, supergong, soskick).

Visualization uses the [Didactic Pattern Visualizer](https://github.com/ivan-abreu/didacticpatternvisualizer/tree/main) (DPV) created by the artist and creative technologist [Iv√°n Abreu](https://ivanabreu.net/). DPV was designed to work with Tidal Cycles leveraging the ability of Tidal to send OSC messages to multiple targets (see the [Tidal OSC docs](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/configuration/MIDIOSC/osc#multiple-targets-and-messages).) With the dual targets, every Tidal channel that has the *connectionN* parameter set will display the visual representation of notes. DPV utilizes the open source visualization program *[Processing](https://processing.org/)* to provide a scrolling grid where colored shapes appear in rhythm reflecting the flow of Tidal events (notes).

### Structure
The organizing idea for *Erratic Rhythms* is to have fully independent parts that work well together and unfold as evolving variations. To ensure part independence, rhythmic values of each part sound in different parts of the beat. There are 4 contrasting parts, each with its own distinct rhythmic and timbral character. The patterns were created so that each voice would stand out without "lining up" on the same beats. The visualization helps each voice stand out.

Each part has a different timbre, using synthesizers available in SuperDirt (superhex, psin, supergong, soskick).
