prepared livecoding compositions - HighHarmonics

This is a collection of pieces I've worked on using the [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org) livecoding platform. 
I compose in tidal by building up and refining sound patterns with prepared code. When I have enough sound patterns ready, these are used dynamically to generate explorations and performances. "Liveness" is preserved with the general guideline to "avoid taking the same path."

### Contents
Each directory represents a separate piece and contains everything needed to realize it in Tidal (sound files not in SuperDirt, SuperCollider synthDefs, etc). 

### Share your code
A common foundation of livecoding is "[share your screens](https://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft)." For me, this is no longer enough. I believe it is important to **share your code**. Seeing livecoding screens is good - but I learn and grow when I can investigate, study and learn the code.
