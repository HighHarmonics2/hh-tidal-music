## Livecoding with Tidal Cycles

These are compositions I've worked on using [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org).  

I compose in Tidal by building up and refining sound patterns with prepared code. I call this "Composed Livecoding." The prepared code frequently includes parameter variants which can be activated/deactivated via code comments. Prepared patterns are designed to enable continuous variation through subtle changes in timbre, rhythm, frequency band, sound duration, etc.

When there are sufficient layers prepared, they are used for live explorations and/or live recordings. "Liveness" has these general principles, loosely applied:
- Avoid taking the same path through the code.
- Every rendition should discover new sounds and combinations.
- There is no fixed final state.
- Prepare a performance version of the tidal file as a consistent starting point. Don't save changes made during each rendition.

Pieces that utilize SuperDirt samples are intended to be freely used, played, adapted, etc by others with no restrictions. When I use custom samples, I will try to also make those available so that anything placed here can be used.
