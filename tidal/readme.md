Livecoding with Tidal Cycles

These are pieces I've worked on in [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org).  

I compose in tidal by building up and refining sound patterns with prepared code. When I have enough layers ready, these are used for live explorations and performances. "Liveness" is preserved with the general guideline to "avoid taking the same path through the code."
