Livecoding with Tidal Cycles

These are pieces I've worked on in [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org).  

I compose in tidal by building up and refining sound patterns with prepared code. The prepared code frequently includes parameter variants which can be activated/deactivated via code comments. When there are sufficient layers prepared, they are used for live explorations and/or live recordings and performances. "Liveness" has these general principles, loosely applied:

- Avoid taking the same path through the code.
- Every rendition should discover new sounds and combinations.
- There is no fixed final state.
- Prepare a performance version of the tidal file and don't save changes made during the rendition.
